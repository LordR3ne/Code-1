<p>After a long and tiring adventure in the Binary Dungeon you just want to get as far away from this place as possible</p>
<p>You see a beautiful sunset that hits the water and lets it glisten in a shining orange</p>
<p>There are two options now: </p>
<p>either you <a href="Cliffs.html">Try to go climb down your way over the dangerous cliffs and hopefully get down unharmed</a></p>
<p>or you <a href="WalkCliffs.html">Walk a tiring road that leads down to the beach. But it would take hours</a></p>
<p>or you <a href="WaitCliffs.html">do nothing</a></p>
