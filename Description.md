Repository:
Commit: A Commit is the snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It's the "save point" in Git, representing a complete set of changes.
Branch: A Branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. It represents an independent line of development within your repository.
Remote:A Remote is a network connection to another copy of the same repository. It's typically a server (like GitHub) where your central repository lives, allowing collaboration.

stage:
commit:
fetch:
pull:
push:
merge:

Meaning of the acronym: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
Who created it, when, and why?
HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1991.
The initial idea was to address the need for automated information sharing among scientists globally. Berners-Lee sought a way for researchers to easily organize and pool information, particularly by linking text within documents (hypertext) to allow for quick cross-references. He released the first version of HTML in 1993.

Origins of "Markup"
The concept of "markup" in the context of computer text processing has roots in the 1960s.

The fundamental idea behind markup languages was to separate the structure of a document from its presentation. Instead of specifying how text should look , markup indicates the role or meaning of the text. This allowed for different rendering devices to interpret and display the content appropriately.

Syntax: Refers to the form or structure of a language. It's the set of rules that dictate how symbols, words, and characters can be combined to form valid statements or programs.

Semantics: Refers to the meaning of a language construct. It's about what a syntactically valid statement or program does or represents. 

Syntax is about form (is it correctly written?).
Semantics is about meaning (does it make sense and do what it's supposed to do?)
