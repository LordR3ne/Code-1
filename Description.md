Repository:
Commit: A Commit is the snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It's the "save point" in Git, representing a complete set of changes.
Branch: A Branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. It represents an independent line of development within your repository.
Remote:A Remote is a network connection to another copy of the same repository. It's typically a server (like GitHub) where your central repository lives, allowing collaboration.
